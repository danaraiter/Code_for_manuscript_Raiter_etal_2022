# Code_for_manuscript_Raiter_etal_2022
Avialable is MATLAB script to decompose the velocity feild and calculate the longitudinally dependent meridional circulation. 
Data used for the calculation is provided. Run the main script ('calc_meridional_circ_from_decomposed_v_main.m') for the entire calculation. 
Output figure is plotted using the script: 'plot_long_dependent_meridional_circ_JJA.m').
Also available is the trajectories calculated for historical and SSP5-8.5 runs of CMIP6 models (for JJA), used in the manuscript in Fig. 3.
